        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I'm someone who trusts my own intuition, guiding me towards personal goals I strive to achieve.
            One of these goals is programming, something I've fallen in love with for a while now, though I haven't always taken it seriously. Recently,
            I recognized a glaring oversight: I hadn't realized time keeps ticking. This prompted me to pursue all my interests to the fullest,
            embracing programming as my current passion. I hope you, the reader, understand that this Github repository will document my programming journey.
            Join me on this journey, starting with my first portfolio! I really hope you like it.
